            I am currently a Post Graduate
                student at Humber College,
                specializing in Enterprise Software
                Development, and I hold an
                Honors Bachelorâ€™s degree in
                Computer Science from York
                University. My proficiency extends
                across various programming
                languages and tools, including
                Python, Java, JS, PostgreSQL, and
                JupyterNotebook. I have also
                pursued coursework in software
                engineering testing, machine
                learning, and data analysis. As I
                look ahead to the next phase of
                my career, I am eager to specialize
                in backend or full stack
                development, applying the
                knowledge and skills I've acquired
                through my academic journey and
                prior experiences to embrace new
                challenges and contribute
                effectively to the
                world of technology.
